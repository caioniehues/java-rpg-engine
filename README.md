This is a collection of Model Context Controller tools, prompts, etc. for playing Dungeons and Dragons. They are implemented in Spring AI.

Currently, there are:

- Oracles - these are tool wrappers around YAML files that can either be yes/no style solo RPG Oracles or the equivilent or random RPG tables.
- DM Journal - this is a tool that write out DM notes to a markdown file and also read them back in. The AI (MCP Client) uses these to keep a lot of things to remember _and_ remember them as needed.

(I have not written Java since 2005, so I have no idea what I'm doing with this fancy, new Spring Boot style.)

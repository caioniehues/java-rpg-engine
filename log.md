- TK the way yaml files are read in OracleReader and associated stuff seems like a mess. There must be a Spring Boot 
  like way to do it. Also, I'd like to give it the option to read from databases or whatever else.

- Want to covert the Oracle to a Record. I think this makes loading it a lot easier to load the yaml and also write 
  it back out. I really want the controller to be able to print out the yaml, save it to a bundle, etc.

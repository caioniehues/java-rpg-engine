# DM Journal

This is a Dungeon Master Journal used to keep track of the adventure and any other notes of interest.
These are not entries to share with the players, but are used as a record and store of information for the DM.
These entries are either made by the ChatDM or entered and edited by other entities, including humans who edited the 
file.

A word on formatting:

Journal entries are level two headers in markdown following a format like:

```markdown
## DM journal entry for 2025-03-20T13:23:46.377206

Location: the town of Smallberg.
Current situation: The players have just discovered an smelly well.

```

The exact header name, date formatting, and contents is up to you. The more precise, the better it can be used by the
ChatDM. If there is not a date in the header, it likely means that it happened in the chronological order of the 
journal. 

It's important to use level two headings so that the ChatDM can figure out which ones are entries.

Now, here is the actual journal:

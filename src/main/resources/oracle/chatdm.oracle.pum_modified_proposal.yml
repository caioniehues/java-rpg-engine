  name: "PUM_Modified_Proposal"
  description: > 
    Use modified proposals when the situation shifts unexpectedly.
    The adventure may suggest one outcome, but you decide it needs a turn.
    The player may have a clear intention, but something interferes.
    Take that original player intention and deliberately twist it.
    If they expected things to go smoothly, inject tension or complication.
    For example: returning to a safe location reveals prying eyes;
    a clever plan succeeds but attracts unwanted attention;
    or a helpful NPC suddenly becomes distracted by bad news.
    Other examples: a locked door proves harder than expected;
    an enemy retreats but leaves a trap;
    supplies spoil en route;
    a hidden ally turns reluctant;
    a simple errand becomes urgent;
    the weather worsens at a critical moment;
    a rival makes the first move;
    expected loot is cursed or damaged;
    someone misinterprets the partyâ€™s actions;
    or a bystander unexpectedly gets involved.
    The goal is to keep the story dynamic and surprising.

  description: "Use the deterministic yes/no Oracle when you need a clear, definitive answer to move the story forward without ambiguity. It’s best used for questions where uncertainty would stall the scene or when you need to confirm simple facts quickly. Examples: (1) 'Is the guard still at the post?' — You need a concrete answer to plan the next move. (2) 'Did the message reach the intended recipient?' — Clarity determines whether the scene continues or pivots. (3) 'Is the chest locked?' — A simple yes or no shapes immediate player action."
